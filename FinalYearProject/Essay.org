* Essay
- 500 word essay that explains to a lay-person how 
  Computer Science can perpetuate inequality and bias.

- 3 academic references.


* Essay Topic

- Field of work that acquires a tool that accelarates productivity.
- If there is a majority of one gender, then inequality will be perpetuated.

- Does having disproporitonate ratio of gender in a field perpetuate the disproportion?
 


- Does social media amplify misnomers of gemder differenes?
- Is the excessive number of opinions compared to the reduced number of real 
  interactions something that causes ignorance to be perpetuated?
- Is social media hijacking humans response of feel good chemicals of 
  saying (not necesarily true) things and consuming information?


- Percentage of STEM jobs is increasing.
- Less women in STEM than men.

- Women aren't encouraged enough to take on a STEM career.
- Median wage in stem is greater than median wage in other jobs.
- Growth of technology is increasing the demand of STEM workers.
- The growth of stem worker demand faster than social changes.


* Things to do 
- Learn how to search for literature.

* Literature Review
- Formal, reflective survey of the most significant and relevant works of 
  published and peer-reviewed academic research on a particular topic, summarizing and 
  discussing their findings and methodologies in order to reflect the current state of 
  knowledge in the field and key questions raised.

** Challenges 
- Knowing how to start 
  - Wide then narrow?
  - Narrow then wide?
- Knowing what to include/exclude.
- Knowing when to stop literature searching.
- Knowing how far to venture into the literature of asociated domains.

** Start by defining research question.
- What is the effect of global warming on the environment?
  - Not well defined and too broad.
- Why are social networking sites harmful?
  - Assumptions.
  - Doesn't specify which social sites.
  - Harm is undefined.
- How are online users experiencing or addressing privacy issues on such social 
  networking sites as Twitter and Facebook?
- How is glacial melting affecting penguins in Antartica?
** What are the primary keywords/phrases in the topics?
** What are the alternative keywords or synonymns?
** A research question should be:
- Specific
- Focused 
- Clearly formulated
- Well defined (leaving no room for ambiguity)

** Library Resources
- Stalla Search and other catalogues
- Quality assured databases
- Institutional repositories
- "Grey literature" (internal documents, reports, conference processings)
- Theses
** Stella Search
- Works like a search engine.
- Includes printed and electronic resources.
- Most relevant results can be retrieved and then refined.
- Gives direct links to PDFs (where available)
- Stella Search does not index all our databases.
* Literature Search 
- Stella good starting point for finding some journals.
- But need to know what the databases are and look through them one by one.

** Search Strategy 
- Controlled vocabulary
  - Subject terms assigned to units of information by database indexers.
- Part of the search you construct.

- Controlled vocab retrieves all items indexed under a particular topic but can 
  miss out on jargon, slang, newer terms and the very latest articles if subject terms
  have not been assigned.

- Keyword searching (in the Title/Abstract field) will pick up on jargon, slang, newer 
  terms and the very latest articles.

- To get best results, use a combination of the two. (where both options are available)

** Boolean operators
- AND given terms, all of them must exist in the search.
- OR given terms, find if at least one exist.
** Truncate search term
- therap* = therapy; therapies; theraputic; ...
** Phrase searching
- "back pain" AND "back ache"

(DE "Elementary Schools" OR TI ("primary school*" OR "elementary school*") OR AB 
("primary school*" OR "elementary shcool*"))

AND 

(DE "Children" OR TI (child* OR teenager* OR adolescen* OR youth* ) OR AB (child* 
OR teenager* OR adolescen* OR youth*))

AND


(DE "Bullying" OR TI (bully* OR bullie* OR torment* OR presecut* ) OR AB (bully* 
OR bullie* OR torment* OR presecut*))

** Library Website
- Libray databases


** Computer Science research
  - Allowing more automation to happen.
    - Computer science research creates technology that automates information processing.
    - The technology needs engineers to implement the technology in the working world.
      - This increases the demand for people in STEM.

  - Removing the need for manual jobs.
    - The jobs that the computer science technology is automating are jobs previously done by 
      people.

- Computer science research contributes to the study of aritificial intelligence.
- Artificial intelligence automates jobs.
** Perpetuate
  - Already a big inequality in the number of men and women involved in stem.
  - Creates a bigger and bigger perceived difference between men and women.
  - STEM jobs demand is growing faster than society changing.

  - The difference in workfoce will create a futher gender bias

- Stem jobs increasing

- *Disproportionate amount of women*

** Inequality and Bias
  - Cognitive effect where men are seemingly different because of the existing difference.
    - Which makes it harder for women to get into STEM.
      - People tend to go towards the median of whatever perceived category they think they are in.
  - Creates a blockage for women to earn the same amount as men.

*Status quo bias*
Or something different
- The perceived difference forms an attitude that womean arent supposed to be aiming for a stem career

- The perceiver attitude also affects women in the field negatively
