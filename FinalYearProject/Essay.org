  - Narrow then wide?

- Well defined (leaving no room for ambiguity)

** Library Resources
- Stalla Search and other catalogues
- Quality assured databases
- Institutional repositories
- "Grey literature" (internal documents, reports, conference processings)
- Theses
** Stella Search
- Works like a search engine.
- Includes printed and electronic resources.
- Most relevant results can be retrieved and then refined.
- Gives direct links to PDFs (where available)
- Stella Search does not index all our databases.
* Literature Search 
- Stella good starting point for finding some journals.
- But need to know what the databases are and look through them one by one.

** Search Strategy 
- Controlled vocabulary
  - Subject terms assigned to units of information by database indexers.
- Part of the search you construct.

- Controlled vocab retrieves all items indexed under a particular topic but can 
  miss out on jargon, slang, newer terms and the very latest articles if subject terms
  have not been assigned.

- Keyword searching (in the Title/Abstract field) will pick up on jargon, slang, newer 
  terms and the very latest articles.

- To get best results, use a combination of the two. (where both options are available)

** Boolean operators
- AND given terms, all of them must exist in the search.
- OR given terms, find if at least one exist.
** Truncate search term
- therap* = therapy; therapies; theraputic; ...
** Phrase searching
- "back pain" AND "back ache"
