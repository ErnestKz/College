* Sample Exam Question - Assignment 3

** (a) APPLICATION QUESTION ~ 70%
- Describe two appraches to find the location of the target in the images.
  (1). Using edge detection.
  (2). Using region detection

- Each solution must consist of a series of computer vision techniques.
  - Include details of how techniques will be applied, with expected input and output for each technique.

** (b) APPLICATION QUESTION ~ 30%
- Given a video of target being shot, taken from static camera.
  - Describe how the shots would be located.
     - Score which shots appear on the target.

- Solution must consist of a series of computer vision techniques.
  - Include details of how techniques will be applied, with expected input and output for each technique.

** Edge Detection Revision
*** Hough transform
- Transforming from image space directly to the likelihood of the existence of 
  some image or shape within the scene.

- Transform image space (x,y) to hough space (r, theta)
- Map edge point to a series of lines

**** algorithm
- Take hough space and initialise every point to 0 

- For any edge point increase the hough accumulator by one
  - Create all the lines that can go through that edge point 

- Then look for the maximum of a circle being in the image 


- Maybe has to be in a particular region in the hough space.

**** Circle
- Have to assume a constant radius r
- (i-a)^2 + (j-b)^2 = r^2

- from image space (x, y)
- to hough space (a, b)

- 3d accumulator, 2 dimensions for the location, 1 dimension for the size


** Region Detection
*** Connectivity & Connected Component Analysis
*** kMeans Clustering

*** Waterhsed Segmentation 
*** Mean Shift Segmentation


** (a) Solution
*** Edge detecion
- Given image 
- Get binary edge image
- 3d hough circles
- Consider top 3 

- Find the top three R values which contain a local maxima.

- Hough circle transform
  - Consider all the local maxima points in the image that has been transformed to hough space
    - Out of the those get the three largest circles





*** Region Detection
- Mean shift segmentation
  - Takes into account spatial location as opposed to k means which does not
- Spatial radius and colour radius

- Take the 4 labels which have the highest pixel cardianlity
  - Discard the one with the highest cardianlity - the outer white region
  - The remaining will be the circles.

** (b) Solution
 - Some sort of background model
   - Would need to adjust to slightly different locations of target.
   - Would need to adjust to the difference in colours.

- Use hough method to retrieve the center of the circles and then look if the point lies within it
  - starting from the smallest
