- 2 dataset 1 file
- 3 columns of data 
  - 2 input features 
  - third positive or negative 1 valued target
* Assignment 
- Go through full ML workflow for each of the datasets
  - Feature selection
  - Model selection
  - Model training and evaluation
- Not all datasets are useful, sometimes fails to capture 
  important relationships or just too noisy

** (i) Start with the first dataset
*** (a) Logistic Regression Workflow
- Augment two features in dataset with polynomail features
- Train logistic regression with L2 penalty 
- Cross validation
  - To select the maximum order polynomial
  - Weight C given penalty in cost function
- Present data
  - Cross-validation plots
    - Error bars in cross validation plots
  - Plots of model predictions and training data
  - Clear explanations to justify choices
*** (b) kNN Classifier
- Use KNN classifier on the data.
- Cross-validation to select k
  - Presenting the data and explanations/analysis
- Explain whether or not worth augmenting features with polynomial features
  for a kNN clasifier.
*** (c) Confusion Matrices for Logisitic Regression and kNN
- Confusion matrix
- One or more baseline classifier confusion matrix 
*** (d) ROC for Logistic Regression and kNN 
- Plot ROC curves
  - Plot in the ROC plot corresponding to baseline classifiers.
*** (e) Evaluate and compare performance
- Using (c) and (d) compare performance of Logistic Regression, kNN, and
   baseline classifiers.
- Is one classifier significantly better or worse than the other?
- How do the ROC curves compare with the random classifier.
- Which classifier recommended?
** (ii) Repeat for second dataset
