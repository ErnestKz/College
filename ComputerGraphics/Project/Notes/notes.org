  2. Multiple different material properties.
     - At least 5 on 5 different objects.
  3. Normal must be transformed correctly.
  4. Shading must use a combination of
     - Ambient

** Advanced features ~ 55%
- 15% per perfectly-executed feature
  - Simple features will receive less.
  - Well-designed features will receive more.

- 55% comes out to possibly 
  - 4 features in total
    - 3 big ones     ~ 45%

* Multipe Spider Management

- A list of spiders
 
- On each draw loop
  - update each spiders meshes
  - draw


- Addition to the model class:
  - Model has a mapping or function
    that takes time as an argument and 
    determines by how much it should move. 

  - Model also has mapping that determines 
    which direction it should rotate.




** Intelligence approach
- define the places you want the spider to 
  travel to 

- spider will move in that direction in a way 
  that its possible

- spiders have a toolset which they can use 
  that allows them to move
  - the spider can only move foward in the direction 
    its facing
  - the spider can rotate its own body
