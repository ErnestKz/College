* Craig Reynolds 'Boids'
- Distributed behavioral model

- Three simple rules.

** Perceptual system of an individual called a boid

- Boids can percieve only their immediate neighbours.

- Boid is modelled as an 'oriented particle'.

** Simple sensory system

- Boid can see certain amount ahead.
- Aware of any flock mates within limits on either side.

- Two parameters:
  - Angle 
  - Distance
- Can only be influenced by other it can sense according to these parameters.

** Rule 1 : Separation
- Keep distance from the rest of the flock.
  - Move away from neighbours that are too close.

** Rule 2: Alignment
- Fly the same direction as visible neighbours.

** Rule 3: Cohesion
- Don't want birds to fly too far apart.
  - Localised flock centering tendency.
  - Move towards the centroid of visible neighbours.


** All Together
- Sum the vectors obtained from idividual behaviours.
  - Top priority: Collision avoidance (static objects)
  - High priority: Collision avoidance (other boids)
  - Moderate priority: Velocity matching (other boids)
  - Moderate priority: Flock centering (other boids)


** Programming
- Define personal space range.
  - For each boid in personal space, increment final angle such that vectors 
    are further away from being parallel

- For each neighbour, increment final angle change such that its closer
  to being parallel

- For each visible neighbour, calculate centroid of the nighbours
  - Calculate 

- Maybe just get the average direction of all the boids
